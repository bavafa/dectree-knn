# spotify-taste
Decision Trees,  k-Nearest Neighbours, and Cross-validation

The aim of this project is predicting users' musical taste based on a public data set from Spotify.
The supervised machine learning task for this dataset is predicting whether the user likes a song or not given a number of song features.

This is project prepared for the BAIT 509: Business Applications of Machine Learning at UBC Sauder School of Business.

The main goals for the project were:

- use the fit and predict paradigms in sklearn.
- use the score method in sklearn to calculate classification accuracy.
- use train_test_split for data splitting and explain the importance of shuffling during data splitting.
- build a decision tree classifier on a real-world dataset.
- build a k-Nearest Neighbours classifier and explore different hyperparameters.
