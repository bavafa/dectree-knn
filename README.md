# dectree-knn
Decision Trees,  k-Nearest Neighbours, and Cross-validation

This is project prepared for the BAIT 509: Business Applications of Machine Learning at UBC Sauder School of Business.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification/home

The main goals for the project were:

- use the fit and predict paradigms in sklearn.
- use the score method in sklearn to calculate classification accuracy.
- use train_test_split for data splitting and explain the importance of shuffling during data splitting.
- build a decision tree classifier on a real-world dataset.
- build a k-Nearest Neighbours classifier and explore different hyperparameters.
